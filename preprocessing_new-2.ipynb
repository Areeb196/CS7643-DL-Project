Pour in oil and toss everything to coat. Turn garlic cut side down and nestle it in so it is in contact with the baking dish. Roast, rotating pan halfway through, until meat is almost falling off the bone, 50\\u201360 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, finely grate 1 garlic clove into a small bowl. Add yogurt, a big pinch of salt, and 1 Tbsp. water and mix well. Set aside yogurt sauce.\\nRemove baking dish from oven and transfer onions, garlic, and lemon to a plate.

Put in the oven and start checking for doneness in 20 minutes; the cake should be done at around 30 minutes.\\nVanilla ice cream really helps pan cake, and so does chocolate whipped cream frosting. Start with 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate, chopped or chips, and 1 pint whipping cream. Put all the chocolate and about 1/2 cup of the cream in a medium mixing bowl and heat over simmering water until the chocolate has melted. Remove from the heat and whisk in the rest of the cream and 1 or 2 teaspoons sugar. Refrigerate until well chilled and then whip until thick and smooth. Be sure the cake is completely cooled before spreading on. If it's a warm day and you're not eating the cake right away, refrigerate it or the chocolate cream will melt right off.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Image_Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13471,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"watermelon-gazpacho-with-feta-crema-51242100.jpg\",\n          \"chocolate-nut-rugelach.jpg\",\n          \"figgy-piggy-cornish-hens-354955.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cleaned_Ingredients\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13443,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['1/2 (3\\\") cinnamon stick, broken into 1/2\\\" pieces with the back of a chef\\u2019s knife', '1/4 cup coriander seeds', '1/4 cup cumin seeds', '1 tablespoon black peppercorns', '2 teaspoons cardamom pods', '1/2 teaspoon whole cloves', '1 tablespoon ground turmeric', '2 cups basmati rice', '6 tablespoons olive oil, divided', '2 medium red onions, sliced, divided', '6 garlic cloves, finely chopped, divided', '1 pound boneless beef chuck, cut into 3/4\\\" pieces (about 3 cups)', '2 tablespoons tomato paste', '2 russet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1\\\" cubes (about 3 cups)', '1 medium carrot, peeled, halved lengthwise, cut crosswise into 1/4\\\"-thick half-moons (about 1 cup)', '1 red bell pepper, sliced into 1/4\\\" strips (about 2 cups)', '5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided', '1 (3\\\") cinnamon stick', '4 whole cloves', '1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1 medium tomato, sliced (about 1 cup)', 'Green or red Somali hot sauce, such as BasBaas, cilantro, lime wedges, and sliced banana (for serving)', 'A spice mill or mortar and pestle']\",\n          \"['2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', '8 large eggs', '1/4 teaspoon kosher salt', '1/2 teaspoon dried oregano', '1/4 cup grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano']\",\n          \"['1/2 cup sugar', '1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch', '7 cups (1 3/4-2 pounds) mixed fresh berries (use no more than 1 \\u00bd cups strawberries;
